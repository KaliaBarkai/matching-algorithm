# matching-algorithm
Matching algorithm made during a Minerva Project internship to help automate matching between student mentors and admitted students.

The repository includes the actual algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and the results of testing it on fake data. The plotly heatmaps do not show up in the notebook on GitHub and can therefore be found in the Heatmaps subfolder

The paper explaining this project can be found in the following link:
